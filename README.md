# Learning Git

This is the begining of my journey learning Git

## Edited in VSCodium

This part was created using VSCodium but to commit I have to use either Terminal or VS Code

## List of useful commands

GIT INIT (initializes git transforms the current/local directory into a git repository)

GIT STATUS (gives a list of files that are either in the Staging area or that have changes to them)

GIT ADD (adds either a file or all the files depending on the way is written)
-- git add fileName.txt (adds the file named fileName.txt to the staging area)
-- git add. (adds all the files that ahave changes to them to the staging area)

GIT COMMIT (sends the file to the commit area setting them ready to upload to the remote repository)
-- git commit -m "type relevant comment here" (is the standard way to make a commit)

GIT PUSH (sends or "pushes" the files that are in the local commit area to the remote repository)
